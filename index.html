      <h2>Hallo Madamoiselle!</h2>
      <div class="letter">
        <p>
          So, this is yet another one of my stoopid love letters to the most
          beautiful girl in the whooole world! I did what you told me to do the
          best of my ability and it turned out quite nice I'd say, anyway you'll
          see it! I just want to say that I love you very very much and this is
          how far I'd go in order to see you smile. I don't know why but as of
          recent you think I'd leave you or I'm cheating on you etc. etc. I
          think both of us know how much I've done just so I can make you feel
          good and safe, so those feelings you have of me cheating on you are
          extremely dumbfounded xD
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, how you say that I hide things, I know I explained this but you
          tend to forget easily so Imma say it again xD I don't hide it, after
          constant rejection and denial due to being depressed and having
          anxiety about it the alts start taking form from it and I gradually
          lose that interest in doing what I wanted to. I'm an 18 year old guy,
          horny as hell, with the stamina of a mountain climber and quite a big
          dick too >.> so I have loooooots of fetishes and needs. It's like when
          I don't see you naked or when you haven't done anything lewd for a
          long time, it feels like you don't wanna do it anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          About your eyelashes and eyebrows! I really don't careeee. I love you
          for who you are and I understand without them you don't feel complete
          but stop being so insecure about yourself! Maybe you look ugly to you,
          maybe in comparison to you, if you think I'm important to you and if I
          think that you're beautiful that's all! You're super cutiepie and a
          bombshell of a girl!
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I will end this love letter by saying that I love you so
          friggin much that not even a second goes by without me thinking of
          you. I know my health isn't really coming along well, and the only
          person I can count on to help me is you. You keep saying that I don't
          know how to get happy right? I do, when I'm happy it feels like
          heaven. I don't need big things to be happy. Love, care, time, strong
          promises and fulfilled words. That's all! Now click the botton below
          to reveal your present!
